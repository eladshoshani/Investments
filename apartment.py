"""
This module is used to estimate the return on investment when buying an apartment, renting it,
and selling it after a few years.

The calculation steps (in high level) are:
1. Calculate the monthly cashflows from the apartment (rent - mortgage payment).
2. Calculate the missed gains from the negative cashflows that could have been invested in the market.
3. Calculate left cash when selling the apartment (sell price - mortgage balance - sell expenses - missed market gains).
4. Calculate the average annual return on the investment.

Notes and assumptions:
    - The calculation does not take into account the tax implications of the investment, and inflation.
        * Most real-estate investments are tax-free in Israel (for a single apartment).
        * When providing the annual market return in the assumptions, it should be after accounting for tax.
            For example, if the market return is 10% and the tax is 25%, then you should provide 7.5%.
        * Not accounting for inflation is a simplification - every investment is affected by inflation...
    - The calculation assumes that the apartment is rented for the entire investment term.
    - The calculation assumes that the apartment is sold at the end of the investment term.
    - The calculation assumes that the rent increases every few years.
    - The calculation assumes that the mortgage is paid in equal monthly payments.
    - The calculation assumes that the mortgage interest is constant throughout the investment term.
        * In reality, the interest rate might change, and the mortgage might be refinanced.
        * As we don't have a crystal ball, we can't predict the future interest rates.
